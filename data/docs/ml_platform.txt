The Machine Learning platform is designed to support the full lifecycle of ML models including data ingestion, feature engineering, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

Models are trained using Python-based frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Training jobs run on cloud-managed compute clusters with autoscaling enabled to optimize cost and performance.

Deployed models are exposed via REST APIs and batch pipelines. Online inference requires low latency and high availability, while batch inference is optimized for throughput.

Monitoring includes tracking model accuracy, data drift, and system metrics such as latency and error rates. Retraining is triggered when performance degradation is detected.

Security is enforced through role-based access control, encrypted data storage, and secret management for API keys and credentials.
