The incident response process defines how the organization responds to system failures, security breaches, and performance degradation.

Incidents are classified based on severity and impact. High-severity incidents require immediate response and escalation.

Response steps include identifying the issue, mitigating impact, restoring services, and conducting post-incident analysis.

Lessons learned from incidents are documented and used to improve system reliability, security controls, and operational procedures.
