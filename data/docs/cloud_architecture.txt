The cloud architecture is built using a multi-region deployment strategy to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.

Core services run on managed Kubernetes clusters. Each service is containerized and deployed using CI/CD pipelines. Infrastructure is defined using Infrastructure as Code tools.

Networking includes private virtual networks, load balancers, and service meshes to control traffic between services. Autoscaling policies are applied based on CPU, memory, and request load.

Cloud storage is used for model artifacts, logs, and datasets. Access to storage resources is restricted using identity and access management policies.

Security best practices include network isolation, encryption in transit and at rest, and continuous vulnerability scanning.
