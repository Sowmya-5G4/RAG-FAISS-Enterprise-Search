Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response.

RAG reduces hallucinations by grounding model outputs in external knowledge sources.

Typical RAG pipelines include document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation, semantic retrieval, and response generation.
